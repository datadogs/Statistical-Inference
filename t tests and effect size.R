# About the data:
# This is an experiment on working memory training (n = 120)
# Dependent variable (DV) is the number of items answered accurately during an intelligence test
# There are 3 independent levels:
#   Time (2 levels): Pre and Post Training
#   Training (2 levels): Training (1) and Control (0) (n_training = 80, n_control = 40)
#   Training sessions (4 levels): 8, 12, 17, 19 (n = 20 for each level)

#summary statistics of all groups

# doing it again) is significant.  What about the effect of training?
